# Chapter 4 Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

## The weresquirrel
Write a log that contains all the data that happens on a day that might cause the the morphing of Jacques.

## Data Sets
To put a lot of data into a set you can use an array to store different values in it.

We can define an array by using brackets. And every value is seperated by commas.

An array starts at 0 instead of 1.
Also calling a specific value out of the array can be done like `listOfLetters[0]`
Above is also called zero based counting.

## Properties
A lot of expressions look like `myString.length` or `Math.max`.
These are expressions that access a property of some value.
those words after the dot are called properties.

all JavaScript values have properties. Except null and undefined.

There are two ways to call a property. Either with a `.` or with `[]` behind the expression. The difference is that the brackets will try to evaluate a property within the expression. Whileas the dot will search for a literal expression.

If we want to call a property within an Array we used the brackets.
